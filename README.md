Stack I work with: React, Typescript, C#, Node.js. Ate teeth on the creation of Sharepoint portals, in particular on the creation of SPFX.


I love working with: React, .NET 7, NextJS. Fed up with chrome extension manifest V3 when you need to reload the extension every time...

- ðŸ”­ At the moment I'm studying C# in depth.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Sharepoint, Azure, React, Networking, valid HTML&CSS 
- ðŸ‘¯ Little by little I start to participate in open source projects and contribute to the community of programmers
- ðŸ“ˆ In free time I do interesting freelance projects
